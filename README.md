 WELCOME TO "KENTUCKY EVER AFTER!"
 ===================================

 This project is for the SEPT 2017 Code Louisville Front End Developer Course.

 All project files can be https://github.com/epicwookiee/kea
====================================

This is meant to be a site to cover our travels both locally and to our favorite
destination, Disney World! Some of these images are from our personal facebook
pages, and some are from google. These are only meant as place holders and not
for the finished product.
====================================

The Navigation should be pretty much straight forward, with the exception of the
suggestion form on the contact page (...it does nothing).
====================================

Thank you for taking the time to view my page, all suggestion are encouraged!
