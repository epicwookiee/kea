    Welcome to our travel site. We are from Louisville, KY, but our adventures
    take us all kinds of places! For the most part, we take short trips to local
    places, but we always have a special place in out hearts for our favorite place
    of all...DISNEY WORLD! On this site, we invite you to join us as we show you
    our favorite foods, attractions and tips for some of the places we go.
