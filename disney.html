          If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go? I’m sure most
          people, given the opportunity, would pick some exotic destination; Ireland
           - to see Stonehenge and to kiss the Blarney stone; England - to tour the
           Tower of London or Big Ben. Or perhaps you just want to lie on a beach
           and drink umbrella drinks all day. Granted, those all sound amazing: but
           where would I go given the chance? You might think I’m a little crazy for
            my answer, and you’re probably right...But a good nine times out of ten
            I’m going to choose Walt Disney World.

      Now, you’re either a Disney fan or you’re not. Some people “get” my love for
      the parks while others can’t comprehend it. Either way, Disney is a place
      where I can relax from adulthood and relive my childhood. From the smells,
      the foods, the rides, and the characters...Disney finds a way to immerse both
       young and old into a world of magic.

      My wife and I have been lucky enough to visit Walt Disney World three years in
       a row now. I also went seven times as a child. Despite going so many times,
       there’s always something new to experience. Here on this page is where I want
        to share my experiences with you.
